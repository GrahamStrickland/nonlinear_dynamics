% Exercise 2.2.5

In Figure~\ref{fig2_2_5vecfield}, we have a plot of the vector field and various graphs 
with different initial conditions for the equation 
\begin{equation}
    \dot{x} = 1 + \frac{1}{2}\cos{x}.
    \label{eq2_2_5vecfield}
\end{equation}
Note that there are no fixed points for Equation~\eqref{eq2_2_5vecfield}, so that these 
are not included in Figure~\ref{fig2_2_5vecfield}.
