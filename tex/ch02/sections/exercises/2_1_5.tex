% Exercise 2.1.5

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] Since the time derivative oscillates with period $2\pi$,
        a mechanical system which is approximately governed by 
        $\dot{x} = \sin{x}$ is a pendulum, with angle of relative to the
        horizontal axis given by $x$ and $x = \pi$ the lowest point in 
        the pendulum's trajectory, i.e., an upside-down Cartesian 
        coordinate system.
    \item[(b)] Since it will always fall back 
        towards the vertical axis when it is suspended perpendiculat to
        the horizontal axis, $x^* = 0$ is an unstable fixed point, while
        $x^* = \pi$ corresponds to the lowest point in the trajectory,
        so that the pendulum will not move if it starts at this point.
\end{itemize}
