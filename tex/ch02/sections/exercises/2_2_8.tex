% Exercise 2.2.8

We are looking for an equation which is consistent with a phase portrait with a 
half-stable fixed point at $x = -1$, a stable fixed point at $x = 0$, and an unstable 
fixed point at $x = 2$. One equation which satisfies these conditions is given by
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
        f(x) &= x{(x + 1)}^2(x - 2) \\
             &= x^4 - 3x^2 - 2x.
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}
We plot the vector field and fixed points for this equation in 
Figure~\ref{fig2_2_8vecfield}.
